title:  "Uniform Reporting API"
---

Many projects want reports. I find myself writing many different variations on the same theme in
different projects. I feel like there's enough similarity within all this that 80% of all reports
could fit within an existing API. That would lead to more reusable code for sorting, filtering... 

So here's what I've seen.

Any uniform reporting API would need:
* Conditions / Filters
  * available fields
    * value format (date, text, integer, ...)
    * options (if enumerable)
    * date / integer limits (not after today. Numbers between 0 and 10) [optional]
    
* Sorting
  * Which fields can be sorted.
  * Which ones are currently sorted
  * multiple sort fields?.... not sure that's even a good idea. [optional and very advanced]
  
* Pagination
  * server-side or client-side
  
In the past I've used the Datatables api because it already a UI. Their API is unfortunate but I was willing to 
live with it. But now that a client is asking for a uniform set of reports, it seems like this is the time 
to look around.
